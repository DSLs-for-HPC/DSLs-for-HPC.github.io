# Guidelines

This space is what we make it. We can work to create a space where we feel comfortable sharing our ideas, being wrong sometimes, and learning from each other. Please read the papers, especially the discussion papers, before class. The point of this class is to get acquainted with recent research in the field and to learn from each other through discussion.

- Share responsibility for including all voices in the conversation. If you tend to have a lot to say, make sure you leave sufficient space to hear from others. If you tend to stay quiet in group discussions, challenge yourself to contribute so others can learn from you. 

- Listen respectfully. Don’t interrupt, turn to technology, or engage in private conversations while others are speaking. Use attentive, courteous body language. Comments that you make (whether asking for clarification, sharing critiques, or expanding on a point) should reflect that you have paid attention to the previous speakers’ comments.

- Be open to changing your perspectives based on what you learn from others. Try to explore new ideas and possibilities. Think critically about the factors that have shaped your perspectives. Seriously consider points-of-view that differ from your current thinking. 

- Understand that we are bound to make mistakes in this space, as anyone does when approaching complex tasks or learning new skills. Strive to see your mistakes and others’ as valuable elements of the learning process. 

- Understand that your words have effects on others. Speak with care. If you learn that something you’ve said was experienced as disrespectful or marginalizing, listen carefully and try to understand that perspective. Learn how you can do better in the future.  

- Understand that others will come to these discussions with different experiences from yours. Be careful about assumptions and generalizations you make based only on your own experience. Be open to hearing and learning from other perspectives. 

- Make an effort to get to know other students. Introduce yourself to students sitting near you. Refer to classmates by name and make eye contact with other students.

- Understand that there are different approaches to solving problems. If you are uncertain about someone else’s approach, ask a question to explore areas of uncertainty. Listen respectfully to how and why the approach could work.

# Discussion Lead Instructions

You may begin the discussion with a short (less than 10 minute) presentation covering the following:
 - Any background that you think is needed to understand the paper.
 - A short summary of the work.
 - Answer questions from the class as they come up.

Please prepare 2-3+ discussion questions covering
 - The merits and shortcomings of the work
 - The work’s role in history and current computing landscape
 - Connections to other papers and concepts we have discussed
 - Any important points raised during your presentation

If you'd like some guidance on discussion questions, refer to [Lindsey Kuper's Instructions for UCSC's CSE290S](https://decomposition.al/CSE290S-2023-01/course-overview.html#how-to-write-discussion-questions)

Finally, moderate the discussion! We'll divide it into two phases, of equal time:
In the first phase, we’ll divide into randomly assigned groups of 3–4 people. Each group will do these things:
    - Introduce yourselves.
    - Talk about the selected discussion questions.
    - Try to reach consensus on the group’s answers.
    - Prepare to present these answers to the full class.

In the second phase, the leader will moderate a full-class discussion on each of the questions. Each small group will report their answers in 3 minutes or less, and then we’ll try to reach a broader consensus on the questions.
