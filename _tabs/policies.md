# Course Policies

## Academic Integrity

Georgia Tech aims to cultivate a community based on trust, academic integrity, and honor. Students are expected to act according to the highest ethical standards. For information on Georgia Tech's Academic Honor Code, please visit: http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/policies/honor-code/ or http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/18/.  Any student suspected of cheating or plagiarizing on a quiz, exam, or assignment will cause immense disappointment to the instructor and be reported to the Office of Student Integrity, who will investigate the incident and identify the appropriate penalty for violations.

## Group Work

Group work is not allowed on homework assignments or projects. Each student must submit their own work. However, students are encouraged to discuss concepts, problems, and projects with each other to enhance understanding. Students will have a chance to discuss or work in groups in class, but all submissions must be individual.

## Grading and Evaluation

This course uses a fixed grading scale. The course will be graded based on participation, homework and a final project.
