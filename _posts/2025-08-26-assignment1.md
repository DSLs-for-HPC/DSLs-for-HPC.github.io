Write an essay about a problem you've been thinking about. Don't write about the solution until the very end. Structure your essay as an introduction to a paper. The goal of the essay is for you to find and formulate a problem relevant to this course (in a very broad sense) that matters to you personally. The essay should be 3 ish pages, following the style guide of an "introduction" section in [CGO's submission template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). It should not propose a solution until the end. The beginning should focus on a programming problem and its properties. Take a look at the [MIT EECS Commkit](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/commkit/journal-article-introduction/) on writing an introduction. I will grade based on whether you provide an abstract, motivate the problem, provide adequate background and related work, explain the utility of your (potentially made-up) solution, and describe 3 novel "contributions" in a contributions statement at the end. I won't be picky about how "good" each section is, I'm just checking for whether it's present.
